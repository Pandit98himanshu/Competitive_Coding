Maximum XOR-sum of a good subsequence :

You are given an array A of n elements as follows:
{a[1], a[2], a[3],.........., a[n]}
You need to find the maximum possible xor sum of any good subsequence of arrayA
Note: A subsequence S is defined as good if the following condition is satisfied:
For every a[i] present in S, a[n-i+1] is also present in S

Input format
• First line: Integer n denoting the size of the array
• Second line: n space-separated integers denoting elements of the array A

Output format
• Print a single integer denoting the maximum xor-sum of any good subsequence.

Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 40
1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9

Sample Input
8
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

Sample Output
13

Explanation
For the above sample input maximum xor-sum of one of the possible good subsequence will be [1 ⨁ 8 ⨁ 3 ⨁ 6 ⨁ 4 ⨁ 5] = 13
