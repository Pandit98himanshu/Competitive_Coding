Safe Paths
There are n cities numbered from 1 to n and there are n — 1 bi-directional roads such that all cities are connected.
There are k trees, each one is in a different city. You are currently in the 1st city.You want to visit city X such that neither X nor the cities in the path from 1 to X has a tree. Find out how many such X you can visit(X != 1).

Input Format
• First line: Integers n, k representing the number of cities and number of trees respectively
• Next n — 1 lines: Two integers u[i] and v[i] meaning there is a road between cities u[i] and v[i]
• Next line: k integers p[1], p[2], p[3], ... ,p[k] where there is a tree at p[i] city

Output Format
Print a single integer denoting the number of cities you can visit.

Input Constraints
1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ k ≤ n
1 ≤ u[i], v[i] ≤ n; u[i] ≠ v[i]
2 ≤ p[i] ≤ n

Sample Input
6 3
1 2
1 6

Sample Output
1

Explanation
There are a total of 5 possibilities
1. 1 -> 2
2. 1 -> 2 -> 3
3. 1 -> 2 -> 4
4. 1 -> 2 -> 5
5. 1 -> 6
In the first 4 cases, the 2nd city has a tree, so he can't go to the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th city. But in the 5th case, none of the cities on the simple path have trees. Therefore, he can go to the 6th city.
